- After 12th commit, I connect my gitHub via different computer. I pushed it with 
force and commits are erased. Therefore, don't use force after first commit of
any code.

- With 10th commit, I split all currency methods even if they can be written in
one method with parameters. I did that since the input that user type doesn't 
return corresponding currency  value. It is better to apply currency method within
one method. Try to merge them later.
